# Relicensing of assembly source code

This document gathers consent by copyright holders of the MIT-licensed
assembly in the SLOTHY repository to relicense it to `Apache-2.0 OR ISC OR MIT`.

The relicensing itself is intended to be carried out once all copyright
holders have given their consent.

## Copyright holders agreeing to relicensing

By adding my name to the list below, I agree to relicensing
the assembly in SLOTHY to `Apache-2.0 OR ISC OR MIT`.

- Hanno Becker <beckphan@amazon.co.uk>
- Matthias Kannwischer <matthias@kannwischer.eu>
- Hugo Vincent <hugo.vincent@arm.com> (on behalf of Arm Ltd, consents to 
  relicensing files in SLOTHY that were derived from pqmx or pqax, for which
  the upstream licensing has already been completed and is concordant with
  this change)
